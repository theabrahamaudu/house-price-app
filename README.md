# house-price-app
This project contains an app which is able to predict the prices of houses in Nigeria.

The prediction model is a Linear Regression Model and the app is deployed using a FastAPI backend and
a Streamlit frontend. 

The app is currently deployed on heroku <a href="https://nigerian-house-price.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.


Training Data Source:  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahiyunus/nigeria-houses-and-prices-dataset">here</a>.

Future Changes:
- Use decision tree model for prediction
- Fix UI bugs
  * Use integers in dropdown selectors
  * Sub-location dropdown menu should be specific to the selected state
